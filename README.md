# Bayes_Sailor_Search
OpenCV - based program for learning the Bayes theorem and how to apply it in the search process

On the screen, there are three squares - the missing sailor is hidden under one of them. In the beginning, user is being shown the initial probabilties of finding the lost person. Using the given menu, user is asked to decide which action to take. Dependingly on the decision, given area is being scanned with random efectiveness. If lost is found, search is ended and the message is shown. If not, newly calculated probabilites and SEPs (search effectiveness probability). Given these values, user can decide which action should be taken next.

In order for program to work, you need OpenCV and numpy libraries. Also, do not miss to download the "cape_python.png" file which is a background for our search.
